I - Required tools

To build this (fantastic) piece of software, you will need:

- Python 2.2 (with win32 bindings)
- Paul Baranowski's Installer:
   http://paulbaranowski.org/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=getit&lid=8
- OCS Inventory v2:
   http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ocsinventory/OCSInventory_2.01R4.zip?download
- InnoSetup 4.2.7: 
   http://downloads.pcworld.com/pub/new/utilities/isetup-4.2.7.exe

At this moment, there are some issue with recent version of python (2.4) and
the setup's code is NOT compatible with InnoSetup v5+ . And the Inventory Agent is
only OCS v2 compatible. Feel free to upgrade ;)

II - Create the environnement

- get the LRS Inventory Agent last trunk
- get PB'Installer tool, uncompress, then move <uncomp dir>/installer_6a2/Installer
  into <build dir>/Installer
- get OCS Inventory v2, uncompress, then move <uncomp dir>/Application into 
  <build dir>/OCS

III - Creating the Agent Binary

Simply run "Build.bat", at the projet root dir. The agent (lrs-inventory.exe)
should appear in the "Spec" dir.

IV - Packaging the Agent Binary

Simply "compile" setup.iss in the "Setup" dir. The setup should appear in the
"Setup" dir.
