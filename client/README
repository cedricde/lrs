Directories
===========

grub.cdrom	: source of the CDROM restoration program
revimage	: source of the binaries which compress a filesystem
src_initrd	: source for the diskless Linux initrd
src_kernel	: makefile for the 2.6 diskless Linux kernel
src_revoboot	: source of the PXE boot loader revoboot.pxe, based on GRUB

The diskless initrd and all the utilities, are taken from a Debian Woody, or
should be recompiled on a Debian Woody. The interesting side effect, is that
if you need to add a binary to the initrd, you just have to drop a Woody 
binary.
