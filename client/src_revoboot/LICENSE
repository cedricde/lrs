IMPORTANT !
===========

Please note that this theme uses Linbox brand and the Linbox logo which 
are subject to trademark law, and that trademark law is not copyright law.
The "Linbox" trademark is a trademark of Linbox Free&Alter soft SARL, 
in France and other countries and is used by permission.

If a user modifies the Software, then the user must replace all images containing 
the "Linbox" trademark.

Linbox FAS grants you the right to use the logo as is, without any 
modification for the sole use within Webmin. The logo ("penguin box" and 
Linbox name) may not be modified in any ways without a prior written 
agreement of Linbox FAS SARL.

It is not incompatible with the GPL since the logo files are not part 
of the program itself (the LRS theme), they are simply data used by that 
program, and changing the logo data has absolutely no effect on the 
functional use of the program.
