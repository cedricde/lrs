            Using the OCSInventory Web interface without installing 
	       the full Linbox Rescue Server software suite.

Prerequisite:
=============

On the server:
- Webmin >= 0.960 (see http://www.webmin.com for more info) installed
  in /usr/share/webmin/
- Apache
- PHP >= 4.1, as an Apache module and also in CGI mode.
  On a Debian Woody: 'php4' and 'php4-cgi'
  On a Mandrake: 'apache2-mod_php' and 'php-cgi'

And on the clients:
- The OCS Inventory Linbox agent >= 2.2.0 available on 
  ftp://ftp.linbox.com/pub/lrs/inventory/
  
The main difference between the Linbox agent and the official one, is that
in its Linbox version, Python scripts will send CSV files generated by the
OCS agent, to a central server using HTTP.

   Lrs-inventory.exe -> OCSInventoryCSV.exe -> Sending of .csv files over HTTP
  

Installation:
=============

- Install the following Webmin modules from the Webmin interface (they are 
  available on ftp://ftp.linbox.com/pub/lrs/webmin)
  - lbs_common-x.x.x.wbm (version 1.3.0 or better),
  - lbs-inventory-x.x.x.wbm (version 1.6.0 or better),
  - lrs-theme-x.x.wbm

- As stated on http://phpwebmin.sf.net , add the following variables to your
  php.ini in case of 'PHP security alert':
 
	cgi.force_redirect=1
	cgi.redirect_status_env="MINISERV_CONFIG"
  
- In the /var/lib/lrs/ directory, create a link from 'php' to the 
  PHP4 CGI binary.
  On a Debian Woody: ln -s /usr/bin/php4 /var/lib/lrs/php
  On a Mandrake: ln -s /usr/bin/php-cgi /var/lib/lrs/php
  
- Install the 'lbs-inventory.conf' file in Apache adding an include in 
  apache.conf or apache2.conf, i.e.:
  
     Include /usr/share/webmin/lbs-inventory/reception_agent/lbs-inventory.conf
     
- Restart Apache.

- The Webmin inventory interface should look like the one shown in the 
  documentation
  (http://linbox.com/ucome.rvt?file=/any/en/Produits/LRS/details/doc/ch06.html)
  and the page http://serveur/lbs-transfer/transfer.php should display 
  'La page est bien accessible.'.
   
  
Checks:
=======

- Run LRSInventory.exe on the client,
- The OCSInventory agent should run,
- Then the client sends some data to the URL specified during the setup. This
  URL can also be found in the config.ini file (usually, 
  http://SERVER/lbs-transfer/transfer.php).
- Client's .csv file should appear in /var/lib/ocsinventory on the server.
