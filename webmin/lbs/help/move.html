<header>Images</header>
The aim of this screen is to move/remove disks images between boot menu,
local directory and the directory containing base images (eg. shared images).
<hr>

<p>
The <b>Boot menu</b> form shows images which are currently associated with
the items of the host's boot menu.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Local images</b> form shows images owned by the current host, but which
are not used in the boot menu.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Base images</b> form contains current base images available to all
registered hosts. These are named 'base' because they can be used in any
host's boot menu.
