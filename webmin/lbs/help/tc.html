<header>Traffic Shaping</header>
You can control here, the maximum network throughput that will be
used by all the clients during a restoration. It's particularly useful
to make sure that your network won't be saturated during a mass OS deployment.
<hr>

<p>
Just specify the name of the related network interface, usually eth0, 
its theoretical throughput, and the allowed throughput. 
<br>Units such as 'mbit', 'kbit' (kilo/mega bits per second) or 'kbps', 'mbps' (kilo/mega bytes per
second) should be specified.
