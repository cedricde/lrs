# functions are simply _written_ here, but when executed, that's as if they where taking place in the main code

# There are some functions to define:
# mainlist_label()      => to receive the labels for each columns in the main list (array)
# mainlist_content($)   => to receive the content for each cell ... (array, arg is the hash 's ref {'group', 'name', 'function', 'mac', ...) identifying the machine, depending on the called module)
# module_status()       => to get a <div> block containing some stats about the current module
# and some functions to get callbacks on them:
# mainlist_label_callback()   
# mainlist_content_callback()
# module_status_callback()  
# and an "init" function to get in the right namespace
