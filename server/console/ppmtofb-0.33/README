ppmtofb: PPM to Framebuffer
---------------------------

** Source Dependencies: Debian packages popt, netpbm-dev, libc6-dev

** To build and run in place, use 'make root' as root, or
   the sequence 'make ppmtofb' 'su' 'make root'

   To build and install, use 'make install' as root, or 
   the sequence 'make ppmtofb' 'su' 'make install'

(The revision history that used to be here is now in the consolidated
 changelog file.)

This program is designed to support rendering P?M graphics to
framebuffer devices under Linux 2.2 (and the Linux/m68k framebuffer
under Linux 2.0).

The following framebuffers are known to work:
  amifb
  pm2fb
  vga16fb
  vesafb

It includes at least rudimentary code for packed pixels, interleaved
bitplanes and normal (full-screen) bitplanes.

Packed pixels are supported at 1, 2, 4, 8 bits per pixel (using a
palette) and at 8, 16, 24 and 32 bits per pixel (in directcolor and
truecolor modes).  Other bits per pixel settings are supported in
directcolor and truecolor where it is implemented on byte boundaries
(e.g. most 15 bpp modes).

Interleaved bitplanes and normal bitplanes are supported at 1-8 bits
per pixel (using a palette).  Interleaves of 2 bytes and the screen
width are supported.

The Amiga's special Hold-and-Modify modes (HAM6 for 4096 colors; HAM8
for 262,144 colors on AGA) are supported at 6 and 8 bits per pixel
(HAM6 is currently somewhat broken, however).

Support is NOT currently included for NeXT-style 12 bit color or for
fixed-palette, non-grayscale graphics (e.g. macfb).  The latter would
require building in some dithering support.

Contributions of code, patches, etc. are greatly welcomed,
particularly patches to fix modes which I can't test here.

NOTE: ppmtofb requires the freely-available popt library for compilation.
