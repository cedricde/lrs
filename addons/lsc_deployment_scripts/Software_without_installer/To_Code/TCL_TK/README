Description: Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a very powerful but easy to learn 
dynamic programming language, suitable for a very wide range of uses, including 
web and desktop applications, networking, administration, testing and many more.
Open source and business-friendly, Tcl is a mature yet evolving language that is
truly cross platform, easily deployed and highly extensible. 
Tk is a graphical user interface toolkit that takes developing desktop 
applications to a higher level than conventional approaches. Tk is the standard 
GUI not only for Tcl, but for many other dynamic languages, and can produce 
rich, native applications that run unchanged across Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and
more. 

The freewrap program turns TCL/TK scripts into single-file binary executable 
programs.
