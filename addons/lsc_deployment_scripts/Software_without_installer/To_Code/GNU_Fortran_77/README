The software "GNU Fortran 77" has not an installer. It's a "zip file". Then, we 
create a directory, and we unzip "g77exe.zip" inside.

File name: g77exe.zip
Directory name: G77
Version: 0.5.25
Installed-Size: 6.65 Mo
Description: GNU Fortran G77 is a free Fortran compiler produced by the Free 
Software Foundation (FSF). The credit for its creation goes to Mr Craig Burley 
of the FSF and the team of very competent individuals that volunteered to help 
polishing and extending the compiler. It can compile Fortran 77 and supports all
the common extensions that finally made it into Fortran 90 specs. The 
executables it produces are as fast as those produced by any commercial compiler.
