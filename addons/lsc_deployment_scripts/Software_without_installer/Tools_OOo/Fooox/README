Tools "fooox" for Open Office has not an installer. It's a "zip file". Then, 
we create a directory "fooox", and we unzip "fooox001b10.zip" inside.

File name: fooox001b10.zip
Directory name: fooox
Version: 1 beta 10

Description: Some people set up their files on their computer in a similar 
fashion that Heathrow International Airport organizes its luggage department: 
you fly to Tokyo and your suitcases wind up in L.A.
You suddenly don’t remember where the H... you’ve saved this or that file on you
r PC? Relax. FoooX will help you to search and find very easily all the 
documents containing a word or another, but also a word AND another.
