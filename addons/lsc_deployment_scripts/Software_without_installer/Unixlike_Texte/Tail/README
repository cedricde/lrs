The software Tail has not an installer. It's a "zip file". Then, we 
create a directory, and we unzip "Tail-4.2.12.zip" inside.

Description: Tail for Win32 is used to monitor changes to files; displaying the 
changed lines in realtime. This makes Tail ideal for watching log files.
Tail has a plugin architecture, which allows notifications to occur when certain
keywords are detected in monitored files. At the moment a MAPI plugin is 
available, and work is in progress on an SMTP version.
