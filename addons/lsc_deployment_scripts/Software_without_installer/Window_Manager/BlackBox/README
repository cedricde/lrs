The software BlackBox has not an installer. It's a "zip file". Then, we create a 
directory, and we unzip "0.0.92_Pack_Sep13.zip" inside.

File name: 0.0.92_Pack_Sep13.zip
Directory name: BlackBox 4 Win 0.0.92
Version: 0.0.92
Installed-Size: 766 Ko
Description: Blackbox shells allow you to interact with your operating system in
much the same way as Windows Explorer. However, Blackbox dispenses with some, or
many, of the graphical features which are a staple of the Windows model.

The file "installBlackBox.bat" is useful of executable "shortcut.exe", to create
