Please replace WinprintHylaFAX-1.2.8.exe with the original installer you may 
found on: http://sourceforge.net/projects/winprinthylafax/

Version: 1.2.8
Installed-Size: <2 Mo
Description: Winprint HylaFAX is a Windows print monitor designed to send its 
output directly to a HylaFAX Server. Once installed, you can print to a HylaFAX
Server from any application, and it will pop up a simple dialog box, allowing 
you to enter the destination FAX number. It's not intended to be fancy or all 
encompassing, just a quick and easy way to send FAXes from any Windows 
application
