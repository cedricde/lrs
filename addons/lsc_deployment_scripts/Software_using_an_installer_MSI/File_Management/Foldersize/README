Please replace FolderSize-2.3.msi with the original installer you may found on: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/foldersize/

Version: 2.3
Installed-Size: 276 Ko
Description: Folder Size for Windows adds a new column to the Details view in 
Windows Explorer. The new column shows not only the size of files, 
but also the size of folders. It keeps track of which folders you view, and 
scans them in the background so you can see complete size of all files within 
the folder. It's very useful for cleaning up your disk. Once you get used to 
having that information available, a directory listing simply looks incomplete 
without it!
