Description: Dia is roughly inspired by the commercial Windows program 'Visio', 
though more geared towards informal diagrams for casual use. It can be used to 
draw many different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special objects to help 
draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, 
and many other diagrams. It is also possible to add support for new shapes by 
writing simple XML files, using a subset of SVG to draw the shape.
