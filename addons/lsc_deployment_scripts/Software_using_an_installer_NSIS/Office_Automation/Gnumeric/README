Description: The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the GNOME desktop environment: 
a project to create a free, user friendly desktop environment.
The goal of Gnumeric is to be the best possible spreadsheet. We are not 
attempting to clone existing applications. However, Gnumeric can read files 
saved with other spreadsheets and we offer a customizable feel that attempts 
to minimize the costs of transition.
